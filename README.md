<h1>First Homework</h1>

1. Create a new Console App (.NET Framework project) and write code that declares a string variable called aboutme and write out a string introducing yourself and what you hope to get out of this course. When you run the program, this text should be printed to the console.

2. In the same Console App. Write a method called Multiply that takes two integers as parameters, multiplies them, and returns the product. Assign the output of this method to an int variable called product.

3. Write a for loop that prints to the console the text "This for loop has run x number of times", once per line. Where x is the number of times the for loop has run at that point.

4. Write a foreach loop that prints out the first names of some of your best friends. These names should be stored in a string array.
